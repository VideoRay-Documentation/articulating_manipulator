      <h2>Parallel Jaw</h2>
      <p>The parallel jaw is the strongest jaw, it can lift objects of up to 45 kg (100 lbs).The parallel jaw is ideal for recovering objects or untangling tether.

        <h2>V-Jaw</h2>
        <p>The v-jaw is slightly weaker than the parallel, but it can open wider to pick up larger objects.The v-jaw is ideal for picking up bulky larger objects, especially netting.</p>

      <p>The sampler jaw allows operators to gather samples up to 45 mL.</p>

    <td class="transparent">
      <h2>Trident</h2>
      <p>The trident jaw works as a "claw", which allows the articulating manipulator arm to pick up much larger objects than the previous manipulator. The trident is able to grasp objects that are more circular,these objects can be difficult to grasp for the parallel and v-jaws.</p>

      <h2>Cutter</h2>
      <p>The cutter jaw can slice through rope or cord up to 1.9 cm (.75 in). The controls for the cutter jaw are inverted.
