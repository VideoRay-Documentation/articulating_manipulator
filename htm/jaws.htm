<h1>Interchangeable Jaws</h1>

<p>There are five different interchangeable jaws - Parallel jaw, V-jaw, Sampler jaw, Trident jaw, and Cutter jaw. These jaws are what make up the flexibility of the Articulating Manipulator. Each jaw has a different purpose and is tailored to a specific situation, which gives the user a large amount of options when using the Videoray Pro 4.</p>

      <h2>Parallel Jaw</h2>
      <p><img src="../../required/images/icon_danger.png"> <img src="../../required/images/icon_caution.png">The Parallel Jaw possesses a closing strength of 25 PSI. Users should be careful when closing the Parallel Jaw to avoid injury. As the strongest jaw, it can lift objects of up to 45 kg (100 lbs).The Parallel Jaw is ideal for recovering objects or untangling tether.

        <h2>V-Jaw</h2>
        <p>The V-Jaw is slightly weaker than the parallel, but it can open wider to pick up larger objects.The V-Jaw is ideal for picking up bulky larger objects, especially netting.</p>

      <h2>Sampler</h2>
      <p>The Sampler Jaw allows operators to gather samples up to 45 ml. The sampler has a rubber gasket seal which prevents water samples from escaping the jaw. What can be sampled is limited only to what can fit within the jaw.</p>

      <h2>Trident</h2>
      <p>The Trident Jaw works as a "claw", which allows the Articulating Manipulator arm to pick up much larger objects than the VideoRay standard manipulator. The trident is able to grab objects that are more circular,these objects can be difficult to grasp for the parallel and v-jaws.</p>

      <p><img src="../../articulating_manipulator/images/caution_cutting.png" width="60" align="right">The cutter Jaw is a potent slicing tool and if not used with care, can do serious harm to the operator or other individuals. The Cutter Jaw can slice through rope or cord up to 1.9 cm (.75 in). The controls for the Cutter Jaw are inverted.
