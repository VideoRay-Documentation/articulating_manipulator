<h2>Software Management</h2>

<p>Operating the Articulating Manipulator requires an installation of VideoRay Cockpit 2015 which can be acquired from the VideoRay flash drive accompanying the kit. The Articulating Manipulator will not function on any previous versions of the Cockpit software.</p>

<h3>1) Download the Cockpit 2015</h3> 

<h3>2) Run Cockpit 2015 Installer Package</h3>

<p>The Articulating Manipulator also requires a specific device file in order to operate properly with our Cockpit software.</p>

<h3>1) Copy the STANDARD_MANIP and STANDARD_INUKTUN_MANIP folders to your desktop.</h3>

<h3>2) In the STANDARD_INUKTUN_MANIP folder please run the AccessoryConfiguration.exe.</h3>
a.	Running the AccessoryConfiguration.exe will install the device file to appropriate location. 

<h3>3) Upon opening Cockpit 2015, you will find that the Cockpit Instrument for the Manipulator is now configured for the Articulating Manipulator.</h3>  

<h3>4) Plug the Articulating Manipulator into the Pro 4 ROV using the Pro 4 cable and verify operations.</h3>

<p>The Cockpit software isnâ€™t configured for automatically being able to switch from the Articulating to our Standard Manipulator. Switching must be done manually with the step below.</p>

<h3>1) Switching back to the Standard Manipulator is done by running the AccessoryConfiguration.exe in the STANDARD_MANIP folder.</h3>

<h2>Inserting and Removing the Articulating Manipulator Jaw</h2>

<h3>1) Connect the Articulating Manipulator Jaw to the body by inserting the body into the jaw's brass piece.</h3>

<h3>2) To attach the Articulating Manipulator Jaw use the 3mm socket wrench located in the tool kit to screw in the brass cap screws.</h3> 

<h3>3) Once the jaw is attached use the Phillips screw driver to put the screws in the Articulating Manipulator head.</h3> 

<h3>4) To remove the jaw simply unscrew the screws holding the jaw, followed by the cap screws. Then remove the head.</h3>

<h2> Mounting the Articulating Manipulator</h2>

<h3>1) To mount the Articulating Manipulator on the VideoRay Pro 4, place the Articulating Manipulator Body on the underside of either the BlueView or standard center float.</h3> 

<h3>2) Position the Articulating Manipulator Body so that the screw holes align to the center float, use the screws to connect the components.</h3>

<h3>3) Align the body and center float in the same way with the BlueView Skid Bottom Plate or the Pro 4 Skid Centre Plate.</h3>

<h3>4) Use the Phillips screw driver to screw in the jaw head screws and connect all the components.</h3>

<h2>Additional Details</h2>

<p>The images above are guides for installation. The first image uses the standard Pro 4 skid plate and center float. The second image substitutes these for a BlueView Skid plate and float. The difference between the two assembly sets is that the standard configuration has a maximum weight limit of 1.14 lbs of extra equipment. With the BlueView Skid and float that changes to a maximum of 1.75 lbs. If the Articulating Manipulator is mounted with the BlueView Sonar the brass Rear Ballast piece should be removed from the back of the manipulator body. This reduces the ROV's weight, and improves the balance of the ROV with the added accessories.
