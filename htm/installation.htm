<h2>Installation/Removal</h2>

<p>The images above are guides for installation. The first image uses the standard Pro 4 skid plate and center float. The second image substitutes these for a BlueView Skid plate and float. The difference between the two assembly sets is that the standard configuration has a maximum weight limit of 1.14 lbs of extra equipment. With the BlueView Skid and float that changes to a maximum of 1.75 lbs. If the Articulating Manipulator is mounted with the BlueView Sonar the brass Rear Ballast piece should be removed from the back of the manipulator body. This reduces the ROV's weight, and improves the balance of the ROV with the added accessories. For more information on individual parts see the <a href="../../articulating_manipulator/html/equipment_.html">equipment guide</a>.</p>  

<p>In order to install the Articulating Manipulator to the VideoRay Pro 4, place the Articulating Manipulator Body on the underside of either the BlueView or standard center float. Position the Articulating Manipulator Body so that the screw holes align to the center float, use the screws to connect the components.Repeat the process with the BlueView Skid Bottom Plate or the Pro 4 Skid Centre Plate. If additional information is needed on VideoRay Pro 4 parts, please see the <a href="../../pro_4/html/equip_.html"> pro 4 equipment guide</a>.</p>

<p>To attach the Articulating Manipulator Jaw, the 3mm socket wrench located in the tool kit is needed. Insert the jaw over the brass. Use the wrench to tighten the cap screws onto the brass. Once the jaw is attached use the screws to secure the head. To remove the jaw simply unscrew the screws holding the jaw, followed by the cap screws. Then remove the head.</p>
