<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Place the centre float on top of the mount plate. Place the Articulating Manipulator over the centre float. Position the Articulating Manipulator so that it can be screwed into the centre float using the 4X M4X40 and M4X25 SHCS screws.</p>

<h3> Standard vs. Blueview Centre Float</h3>

<p>If heavy accessories are equipped to the Pro 4 the Blueview Float should be used and the rear ballast should be detached. If the standard is used with heavy accessories the ROV will sink.</p>
