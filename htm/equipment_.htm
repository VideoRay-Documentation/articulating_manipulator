<h2>Installation</h2>

<p> The image above is a guide for installation. In order to install the Articulating Manipulator to the Videoray Pro 4, place the centre float on top of the Blueview Skid Bottom Plate or the Pro 4 Skid Centre Plate, seen <a href="../../articulating_manipulator/html/qs_predrive.html">here</a>. Place the Articulating Manipulator over the centre float. Position the Articulating Manipulator so that it can be screwed into the centre float using the 4X M4X40 and M4X25 SHCS screws.</p>

<h3> Standard vs. Blueview Centre Float</h3>

<p>If heavy accessories are equipped to the Pro 4 the Blueview Float should be used and the rear ballast should be detached. If the standard is used with heavy accessories the ROV will sink.</p>
