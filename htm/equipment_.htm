   <h3>1.Articulating Manipulator Body & Ballast</h3>
  <p>Body- The Articulating Manipulator Body is what  connects the jaws to the center float and skid plate. The Body has a ballast at the end that can be removed at will. It may be in the user's interest to remove the ballast if using accessories that would go over the Blueview Center Float's weight limit. The VideoRay Center Float should not be equipped with the ballast.</p>

   <h3>2B.Blueview Center Float</h3>
   <p>Blueview Center- The Blueview Center Float attaches to the articulating Manipulator the same way that the standard does. With the BlueView Float and no ballast, the ROV can handle a maximum of 1.75 lbs of extra weight. If the BlueView Sonar is attached it takes up all weight capacity. If the sonar is attached, there is no room for any other accessories.</p>

<h3>Standard vs. BlueView Center Float</h3>

<p>With just the standard float and no ballast, the ROV can handle a maximum of 1.14 lbs of extra weight. With the BlueView float and no ballast, the ROV can handle a maximum of 1.75 lbs of extra weight. The BlueView sonar takes up all the extra weight capacity here, so if you have the sonar attached, there is no room for any other accessories. 
If heavy accessories are equipped to the Pro 4 the BlueView Float should be used and the rear ballast should be detached. If the standard is used with heavy accessories it is possible that the ROV could sink.</p>
