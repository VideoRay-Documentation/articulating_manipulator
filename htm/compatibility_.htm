<h2>Component Compatibility</h2>

<p> The Articulating Manipulator is compatible with the Pro 4.</p> 

<h3>Standard and BlueView Center Float</h3>

<p>With just the standard float and no ballast, the ROV can handle a maximum of 1.14 lbs of extra weight. With the BlueView float and no ballast, the ROV can handle a maximum of 1.75 lbs of extra weight. The BlueView sonar takes up all the extra weight capacity here, so if you have the sonar attached, there is no room for any other accessories. 
If heavy accessories are equipped to the Pro 4 the BlueView Float should be used and the rear ballast should be detached. If the standard is used with heavy accessories it is possible that the ROV could sink.</p>

<h3>Communications</h3>

<p>The Articulating Manipulator uses the Cockpit software to communicate with the Videoray Pro 4. See the <a href="../../articulating_manipulator/html/software_.html">software guide</a> for more details. </p>



<h3>Mounting</h3>

<p> The Articulating Manipulator can be mounted by attaching it to the centre float and mount plate. See the <a href="equipment_.html">equipment guide</a>.</p>
