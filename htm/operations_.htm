<h1>Operations Guide</h1>

<p>The Articulating Manipulator is operated by the use of the <a href="../../pro_4/html/equip_controller.html" target="_blank"> Hand Controller</a>. The Hand Controller dictates the movements of the Articulating Manipulator with a two button open and close method of operation.</p>

*Installation - For aid with installing hardware and software, please take a look at the <a href="../../articulating_manipulator/html/software_.html">software</a> and <a href="../../articulating_manipulator/html/equipment_.html">equipment guides</a>. 

<p>Jaws - All 5 jaws operate similarly with the controller opening and closing the head.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_danger.png"> <img src="../../required/images/icon_caution.png">The Parallel Jaw should be used when picking up heavier objects. Be careful of the jaw's closing power, it is possible to inflict harm if not used properly.</p> 

<p>The Sampler Jaw should be used when dirt or water samples need to be taken. The sampler has a water tight seal so water samples from particular places or depths can be found.</p>

<p><img src="../../articulating_manipulator/images/caution_cutting.png" width="60" >The Cutter Jaw is used when there are objects that need to be sheared or cut away.The Cutter Jaw is very sharp and should be used with caution. A disntinction between the Cutter Jaw and the other 4, is that it's controls are inverted. When operating the Hand Controller it will work opposite of the other jaws. </p>

<p>The Trident Jaw is capable of grasping circular objects that might elude the Parallel Jaw.</p>

<p>The V-Jaw is slightly wider than the Parallel Jaw and can grasp larger objects, although it is slightly weaker.</p>

<h2>Tactics</h2> 

<p> An almost limitless number of specialized actions can be performed with the Articulating Manipulator thanks to the multi functionality of it's 5 heads. Some tactics to try with the manipulator are:</p> 

<p>Retrieving heavy objects from the Parallel Jaw that would normally exceed the maximum weight by way of pulling on the retrieving cable.</p> 

<p>Using a jaw and the rotation feature to turn a valve or bolt.</p>
