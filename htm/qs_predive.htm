<h2>Installing/Removing the Jaw</h2>
<p>To mount the Articulating Manipulator first select the preferred jaw. Insert the brass piece on the inside of the jaw into the body and use the 3mm socket wrench to screw in the brass cap screws. Next use the Phillip's screw driver to screw in the manipulator screws. To remove the jaw simply unscrew the manipulator and cap screws.</p> 

<h2> Mounting the Articulating Manipulator</h2>
<p>After the jaw is attached place the body on the underside of the center float where there are grooves to fit the body. Position the body so that the screw holes align with the center float's. Next match the screw holes of the center float with the skid bottom plate. Attach the skid bottom plate to the Pro 4 ROV and screw in the components using the tool kit wrench. Lastly, perform a functions test, and check to make sure all components are secured tightly.
