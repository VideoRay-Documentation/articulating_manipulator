<h1>Software Guide</h1>

<p>A VideoRay Pro 4 ROV System accompanied with VideoRay Cockpit version 1.10.2.3 or newer is required to use the Articulating Manipulator. An installation of config files that can be found on a flash drive included in the kit is necessary to operate the Articulating Manipulator. This can be accomplished by running the appropriate accessory device configuration AccessoryConfiguration.exe. The Articulating Manipulator kit comes with a flash drive that contains these config files, but alternatively they can be downloaded from the VideoRay website.</p>	

<p> Running the config will install the accessory device file. This file identifies the Articulating Manipulator to Cockpit and establishes a connection. If this file exists in the proper directory then the manip instrument will be visible. This process will also install (overwrite) the hand controller configuration file, which is responsible for telling Cockpit how to map the Hand Controller to specific actions.The new controller configuration will map the open,close, and joystick rotate actions to the Articulating Manipulator.</p>
