<p>Using the <a href="../../pro_4/html/controller_manip.html"target="_blank">Hand Controller</a>, the Articulating Manipulator can grasp,scoop up,cut,and retrieve submerged objects. The resourcefulness of the Articulating Manipulator's five jaws allows it to retrieve items in confined or hazardous locations. The Articulating Manipulator is capable of lifting objects underwater too heavy for the ROV to lift under its own power by grasping them while the operator pulls the tether of the ROV to the surface. The VideoRay ROV's camera can be tilted down to focus in on the jaw to provide a close view of the manipulator. When not needed the Articulating Manipulator can easily be detached.</p>
